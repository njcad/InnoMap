Our data folder contains our original Kaggle dataset, which can be found via the link in the description therein. It also contains code to generate graphs for the training dataset as well as the eval dataset. 
Beyond this, please make use of our source code folder to find our model.py, train.py, and evaluate.py. Importantly, other files in this folder are not necessarily useful in this project, and are largely for additional testing.
Also see our results folder, wherein you will find the confusion_matrix.png, which is a confusion matrix from the learned GCN model on evaluation, and also our new_text_predictions.txt, which has examples of our downstream task.
