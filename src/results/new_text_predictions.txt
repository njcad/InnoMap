We combine deep learning algorithms with historical weather and vegetation density maps to predict wildfire spread, enabling proactive evacuation alerts and targeted aerial firefighting interventions. Early field tests have demonstrated robust performance in diverse terrains and varying environmental conditions, ensuring that the proposed approach can significantly mitigate ecological and economic damage caused by wildfires.

  Title: Unsupervised Change Detection From Multichannel SAR Data by Markovian Data Fusion
  Abstract: In applications related to environmental monitoring and disaster management, multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data present a great potential, owing both to their insensitivity to atmospheric and Sun-illumination conditions and to the improved discrimination capability they may provide as compared with single-channel SAR. However, exploiting this potential requires accurate and automatic techniques to generate change maps from (multichannel) SAR images acquired over the same geographic region in different polarizations or at different frequencies at different times. In this paper, a contextual unsupervised change-detection technique (based on a data-fusion approach) is proposed for two-date multichannel SAR images. Each SAR channel is modeled as a distinct information source, and a Markovian approach to data fusion is adopted. A Markov random field model is introduced that combines together the information conveyed by each SAR channel and the spatial contextual information concerning the correlation among neighboring pixels and formulated by using ldquoenergy functions.rdquo In order to address the task of the estimation of the model parameters, the expectation-maximization algorithm is combined with the recently proposed ldquomethod of log-cumulants.rdquo The proposed technique was experimentally validated with semisimulated multipolarization and multifrequency data and with real SIR-C/XSAR images.

  Title: Model selection approaches for non-linear system identification: a review
  Abstract: The identification of non-linear systems using only observed finite datasets has become a mature research area over the last two decades. A class of linear-in-the-parameter models with universal approximation capabilities have been intensively studied and widely used due to the availability of many linear-learning algorithms and their inherent convergence conditions. This article presents a systematic overview of basic research on model selection approaches for linear-in-the-parameter models. One of the fundamental problems in non-linear system identification is to find the minimal model with the best model generalisation performance from observational data only. The important concepts in achieving good model generalisation used in various non-linear system-identification algorithms are first reviewed, including Bayesian parameter regularisation and models selective criteria based on the cross validation and experimental design. A significant advance in machine learning has been the development of the support vector machine as a means for identifying kernel models based on the structural risk minimisation principle. The developments on the convex optimisation-based model construction algorithms including the support vector regression algorithms are outlined. Input selection algorithms and on-line system identification algorithms are also included in this review. Finally, some industrial applications of non-linear models are discussed.

  Title: Constructive incremental learning from only local information
  Abstract: We introduce a constructive, incremental learning system for regression problems that models data by means of spatially localized linear models. In contrast to other approaches, the size and shape of the receptive field of each locally linear model, as well as the parameters of the locally linear model itself, are learned independently, that is, without the need for competition or any other kind of communication. Independent learning is accomplished by incrementally minimizing a weighted local cross-validation error. As a result, we obtain a learning system that can allocate resources as needed while dealing with the bias-variance dilemma in a principled way. The spatial localization of the linear models increases robustness toward negative interference. Our learning system can be interpreted as a nonparametric adaptive bandwidth smoother, as a mixture of experts where the experts are trained in isolation, and as a learning system that profits from combining independent expert knowledge on the same problem. This article illustrates the potential learning capabilities of purely local learning and offers an interesting and powerful approach to learning with receptive fields.

  Title: A comprehensive review for industrial applicability of artificial neural networks
  Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive review of the industrial applications of artificial neural networks (ANNs), in the last 12 years. Common questions that arise to practitioners and control engineers while deciding how to use NNs for specific industrial tasks are answered. Workable issues regarding implementation details, training and performance evaluation of such algorithms are also discussed, based on a judiciously chronological organization of topologies and training methods effectively used in the past years. The most popular ANN topologies and training methods are listed and briefly discussed, as a reference to the application engineer. Finally, ANN industrial applications are grouped and tabulated by their main functions and what they actually performed on the referenced papers. The authors prepared this paper bearing in mind that an organized and normalized review would be suitable to help industrial managing and operational personnel decide which kind of ANN topology and training method would be adequate for their specific problems.

  Title: A Novel Approach to Unsupervised Change Detection Based on a Semisupervised SVM and a Similarity Measure
  Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to unsupervised change detection in multispectral remote-sensing images. The proposed approach aims at extracting the change information by jointly analyzing the spectral channels of multitemporal images in the original feature space without any training data. This is accomplished by using a selective Bayesian thresholding for deriving a pseudotraining set that is necessary for initializing an adequately defined binary semisupervised support vector machine classifier. Starting from these initial seeds, the performs change detection in the original multitemporal feature space by gradually considering unlabeled patterns in the definition of the decision boundary between changed and unchanged pixels according to a semisupervised learning algorithm. This algorithm models the full complexity of the change-detection problem, which is only partially represented from the seed pixels included in the pseudotraining set. The values of the classifier parameters are then defined according to a novel unsupervised model-selection technique based on a similarity measure between change-detection maps obtained with different settings. Experimental results obtained on different multispectral remote-sensing images confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

  Title: Robust Change Vector Analysis (RCVA) for multi-sensor very high resolution optical satellite data
  Abstract: The analysis of rapid land cover/land use changes by means of remote sensing is often based on data acquired under varying and occasionally unfavorable conditions. In addition, such analyses frequently use data acquired by different sensor systems. These acquisitions often differ with respect to sun position and sensor viewing geometry which lead to characteristic effects in each image. These differences may have a negative impact on reliable change detection. Here, we propose an approach called Robust Change Vector Analysis (RCVA), aiming to mitigate these effects. RCVA is an improvement of the widely-used Change Vector Analysis (CVA), developed to account for pixel neighborhood effects. We used a RapidEye and Kompsat-2 cross-sensor change detection test to demonstrate the efficiency of RCVA. Our analysis showed that RCVA results in fewer false negatives as well as false positives when compared to CVA under similar test conditions. We conclude that RCVA is a powerful technique which can be utilized to reduce spurious changes in bi-temporal change detection analyses based on high- or very-high spatial resolution imagery.

  Title: Optical techniques for 3D surface reconstruction in computer-assisted laparoscopic surgery
  Abstract: One of the main challenges for computer-assisted surgery (CAS) is to determine the intra-operative morphology and motion of soft-tissues. This information is prerequisite to the registration of multi-modal patient-specific data for enhancing the surgeon’s navigation capabilities by observing beyond exposed tissue surfaces and for providing intelligent control of robotic-assisted instruments. In minimally invasive surgery (MIS), optical techniques are an increasingly attractive approach for in vivo 3D reconstruction of the soft-tissue surface geometry. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art methods for optical intra-operative 3D reconstruction in laparoscopic surgery and discusses the technical challenges and future perspectives towards clinical translation. With the recent paradigm shift of surgical practice towards MIS and new developments in 3D optical imaging, this is a timely discussion about technologies that could facilitate complex CAS procedures in dynamic and deformable anatomical regions.

  Title: An adaptive semiparametric and context-based approach to unsupervised change detection in multitemporal remote-sensing images
  Abstract: A novel automatic approach to the unsupervised identification of changes in multitemporal remote-sensing images is proposed. This approach, unlike classical ones, is based on the formulation of the unsupervised change-detection problem in terms of the Bayesian decision theory. In this context, an adaptive semiparametric technique for the unsupervised estimation of the statistical terms associated with the gray levels of changed and unchanged pixels in a difference image is presented. Such a technique exploits the effectivenesses of two theoretically well-founded estimation procedures: the reduced Parzen estimate (RPE) procedure and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Then, thanks to the resulting estimates and to a Markov random field (MRF) approach used to model the spatial-contextual information contained in the multitemporal images considered, a change detection map is generated. The adaptive semiparametric nature of the proposed technique allows its application to different kinds of remote-sensing images. Experimental results, obtained on two sets of multitemporal remote-sensing images acquired by two different sensors, confirm the validity of the proposed approach.

  Title: A change detection method for remotely sensed multispectral and multitemporal images using 3-D segmentation
  Abstract: A new method is proposed fur detection of the temporal changes using three-dimensional (3D) segmentation. The method is a kind of clustering methods for temporal changes. In the method, multitemporal images form a image block in 3D space; x-y plane and time axis. The image block is first divided into spatially uniform sub-blocks by applying binary division process. The division rule is based on the statistical t-test using Mahalanobis distance between spatial coefficient vectors of a local regression model fitted to neighboring sub-blocks to be divided. The divided sub-blocks are then merged into clusters using a clustering technique. The block-based processing, like the spatial segmentation technique, is very effective in reduction of apparent changes due to noise. Temporal change is detected as a boundary perpendicular to the time axis in the segmentation result. The proposed method is successfully applied to actual multitemporal and multispectral LANDSAT/TM images.

  Title: Implementation and Self-Tuning Adaptive Control Design of an Electromagnetic Submicro-positioner
  Abstract: A novel, compact and two degree-of-freedom (DOF) submicro-positioner with a large travel range is presented. The design of the submicro-positioner utilizes a monolithic parallel flexure mechanism with built-in electromagnetic actuators and eddy current sensors to achieve the 2-DOF motion. We have analyzed the dynamics of the positioner and derived its analytical model. The whole control architecture takes two configuration parameters measured by the two sensors and endeavors to control the 2-DOF motion through regulating the current in the electromagnetic actuators. To let the compact system be more robust and stable in positioning, we propose a self-tuning adaptive controller( STA) to improve the system regulation and tracking performances. From the experimental results, satisfactory performances of the system, including stiffness and precision, have been successfully demonstrated.

  Title: Compliant constant-force mechanism with a variable output for micro/macro applications
  Abstract: The relationship between input deflection and output force is fixed for constant-force mechanisms. An advantage of a constant-force mechanism is that the control effort is minimized. For example, in grasping applications, if the grasp force is understood and given, then the mechanism will apply the constant-force even if there are small deflections. A double-slider, variable, constant-force mechanism is developed in this paper. The force relationship is analyzed using the virtual network principle. An active control law is used to generate a variable constant-force output. The paper also discusses the experimental validation of the force relationship using springs and also compliant plastic materials. This macro-level research is a step towards developing the technical capability to design micro constant-force mechanisms.

  Title: M3: Multiscale, Deterministic and Reconfigurable Macro-Micro Assembly System for Packaging of MEMS
  Abstract: This paper presents recent results in configuring a multiscale (macro-micro) robotic assembly platform with modular and reconfigurable characteristics. M3 is a multi-robot system capable of spanning across the macro-meso-micro scales, and has been specifically designed to package MOEMS (Micro Opto Electro Mechanical Systems). The emphasis on packaging (as opposed to assembly) is inclusive of the latter, but it also recognizes that bonding, sealing and attachment processes must also be controlled, and will greatly influence the reliability of the microsystem. The system components include precision robots, microstages, end-effectors and fixtures that accomplish assembly tasks in a shared workspace. The system components are systematically characterized in terms of accuracy and repeatability, and assembly plans are performed using kinematic identification, visual servoing, inverse kinematics, and dynamic vibration suppression. As an application packaging problem, various micro and mesoscale parts are assembled into a MEMS device. The tolerance budget of assembly ranges from 4 microns to 300 microns, while the size of components in the assembly ranges from 126 microns to 30mm. Various end-effectors and fixtures have been designed for use with off-the-shelf hardware (robots and microstages) and were tested for precision performance. The robots are calibrated to accuracies of 10 microns or less. In this paper we present experimental results of precision robot calibration and visual servoing for fiber pigtailing with one of the robots within M3

  Title: Output characteristic analysis of a 3-DOF spatial parallel micromanipulator
  Abstract: This paper proposes a kind of 3 degree-of-freedom spatial parallel micromanipulator driven by linear ultrasonic motors, as well as the kinematic and dynamic analysis. The micromanipulator is a parallel mechanism jointed by flexible hinges. It has two fingers and the moving finger is driven by linear ultrasonic motors which possess plenty of advantages such as high displacement resolution, fast response time and large workspace. The kinematic model of the micromanipulator is built and the mathematical relationship between the output displacement and the input displacement is derived. Utilizing Pro-E, ANSYS and ADAMS software, the dynamic model of the micromanipulator is established and the displacement, velocity and acceleration characteristics on x,y,z axes are analyzed respectively. The maximum operating speed of the end-effector is calculated as 216 mm/s. Experiments indicate that the micromanipulator manages to grip micro-particles of different sizes. The maximum operational workspace of the micromanipulator can reach 2 mm×2 mm×20 mm, while the displacement resolution is 100 nm.

  Title: Three-Layered Control Architecture for Microassembly with Human-Robot Task Plan Interaction
  Abstract: Assembly manipulation in the micro world presents challenges not found in the macro domain. A three-layered control architecture for microassembly with human-robot task plan interaction is proposed in this paper. The architecture combines the abilities of human decision making and task planning with visual servo strategies to ensure the reliability and automaticity of micromanipulation. It has three control levels: the behaviour layer interacts with the real physical world to control actuators and sensors. The task layer specifies assembly goals by human task planning. As the middle level, the strategy layer yields visual servo schemes from abstract assembly goals and expands them into low-level behaviour commands. TaskML, the task markup language, is designed based on XML for human task planning. Task plan tree (TPT) data specifies microassembly tasks underlying TaskML. Microassembly task planner (MTP) software has been developed to support TaskML editing and task plan tree building

  Title: Behavior of a magnetic manipulator of biological objects
  Abstract: Deals with manipulation of biological objects in an extremely confined space with a magnetic microactuator. Objects are pushed with a small magnetic particle (100/spl times/100/spl times/20 /spl mu/m/sup 3/) which is moved thanks to a permanent magnet. This device allows us to push micro-objects located in water between two glass panes. The distance between both glass panes is few hundred microns. The precision (1 /spl mu/m) is limited by the pixel size of the camera. We define the dynamic behavior of the manipulator. We also describe the control strategy used to achieve a good precision despite the "stick slip effect".

  Title: Versatile aerial grasping using self-sealing suction
  Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of versatile aerial grasping utilizing suction while considering the limitations of an on-board vacuum pump. It builds upon our patented self-sealing suction cup technology, which allows the exertion of local pulling contact forces for grasping a wide range of objects. The novel self-sealing nature of the cups enables the gripper to be versatile, employing just one, several, or all of the cups for the grasp in a passively actuated manner. We begin by describing the design of the system and its components. Because aerial applications are typically sensitive to weight constraints, we used a micro-pump vacuum generator, which introduced new challenges for our system. To investigate and overcome those challenges, we tested the relationship between the cup's design and its leakage, activation force, and maximum holding force. In addition, we tested the performance of the individual gripper components, the aerial vehicle's ability to transfer force to the cups, the system's ability to grip inclined surfaces, and finally the vehicle's ability to grasp a multitude of objects using various numbers of cups. This included the grasping of one object, followed by the grasping of a second object while still holding the first object.

  Title: Representation of robot motion control skill
  Abstract: Development of skilled robotics draws clues from model based theories of human motor control. Thus, a comprehensive anthropomorphic background is given. Skills in robotics are viewed as a tool for fast and efficient real time control that can handle complexity and nonlinearity of robots, generally aiming at robot autonomy. In particular, a skill of redundancy resolution is addressed through a skill representation problem based on Function Approximator. The task of the robot is approximated by a set of parameterized motion primitives. Adopted parameters are also parameters of the function approximator, i.e., skill used. Redundancy is resolved during skill learning based on available expert knowledge, yielding parameterized joint motions. The approximation procedure (Successive Approximations), a major contribution of the paper, is used for batch compilation of parameterized examples, resulting in a parameterized skill model. Such skill enables a user, inexpert in redundancy resolution, to gain benefits from redundant robots. All properties of the Successive Approximations procedure such as accuracy in interpolation and extrapolation, acceleration in redundancy resolution and upgrading to new skill regarding the task variation, are discussed in the example of a five degrees-of-freedom planar redundant robot, performing parameterized ellipse as motion primitive.

  Title: Using electronic patient records to discover disease correlations and stratify patient cohorts
  Abstract: Electronic patient records remain a rather unexplored, but potentially rich data source for discovering correlations between diseases. We describe a general approach for gathering phenotypic descriptions of patients from medical records in a systematic and non-cohort dependent manner. By extracting phenotype information from the free-text in such records we demonstrate that we can extend the information contained in the structured record data, and use it for producing fine-grained patient stratification and disease co-occurrence statistics. The approach uses a dictionary based on the International Classification of Disease ontology and is therefore in principle language independent. As a use case we show how records from a Danish psychiatric hospital lead to the identification of disease correlations, which subsequently can be mapped to systems biology frameworks.

  Title: Incorporating Pharmacogenomics into Health Information Technology, Electronic Health Record and Decision Support System: An Overview
  Abstract: As the adoption of information technology in healthcare is rising, the potentiality of moving Pharmacogenomics from benchside to bedside is aggravated. This paper reviews the current status of Pharmacogenomics (PGx) information and the attempts for incorporating them into the Electronic Health Record (EHR) system through Decision Support Systems (DSSs). Rigorous review strategies of PGx information and providing context-relevant recommendations in form of action plan- dose adjustment, lab tests rather than just information- would be ideal for making clinical recommendations out of PGx information. Lastly, realistic projections of what pharmacogenomics can provide is another important aspect in incorporating Pharmacogenomics into health information technology.

  Abstract: Network biomarker as a new type of biomarkers with protein-protein interactions was initiated and investigated with the integration of knowledge on protein annotations, interaction, and signaling pathway. A number of methodologies and computational programs have been developed to integrate selected proteins into the knowledge-based networks via the combination of genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics. Alterations of network biomarkers can be monitored and evaluated at different stages and time points during the development of diseases, named dynamic network biomarkers. Dynamic network biomarkers should be furthermore correlated with clinical informatics, including patient complaints, history, therapies, clinical symptoms and signs, physician's examinations, biochemical analyses, imaging profiles, pathologies and other measurements.

  Title: Structure and dynamics of molecular networks: A novel paradigm of drug discovery: A comprehensive review
  Abstract: Despite considerable progress in genome- and proteome-based high-throughput screening methods and in rational drug design, the increase in approved drugs in the past decade did not match the increase of drug development costs. Network description and analysis not only give a systems-level understanding of drug action and disease complexity, but can also help to improve the efficiency of drug design. We give a comprehensive assessment of the analytical tools of network topology and dynamics. The state-of-the-art use of chemical similarity, protein structure, protein-protein interaction, signaling, genetic interaction and metabolic networks in the discovery of drug targets is summarized. We propose that network targeting follows two basic strategies. The "central hit strategy" selectively targets central nodes/edges of the flexible networks of infectious agents or cancer cells to kill them. The "network influence strategy" works against other diseases, where an efficient reconfiguration of rigid networks needs to be achieved by targeting the neighbors of central nodes/edges. It is shown how network techniques can help in the identification of single-target, edgetic, multi-target and allo-network drug target candidates. We review the recent boom in network methods helping hit identification, lead selection optimizing drug efficacy, as well as minimizing side-effects and drug toxicity. Successful network-based drug development strategies are shown through the examples of infections, cancer, metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Summarizing >1200 references we suggest an optimized protocol of network-aided drug development, and provide a list of systems-level hallmarks of drug quality. Finally, we highlight network-related drug development trends helping to achieve these hallmarks by a cohesive, global approach.

  Title: crcTRP: a translational research platform for colorectal cancer.
  Abstract: Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality in both developed and developing countries. Transforming basic research results into clinical practice is one of the key tasks of translational research, which will greatly improve the diagnosis and treatments of colorectal cancer. In this paper, a translational research platform for colorectal cancer, named crcTRP, is introduced. crcTRP serves the colorectal cancer translational research by providing various types of biomedical information related with colorectal cancer to the community. The information, including clinical data, epidemiology data, individual omics data, and public omics data, was collected through a multisource biomedical information collection solution and then integrated in a clinic-omics database, which was constructed with EAV-ER model for flexibility and efficiency. A preliminary exploration of conducting translational research on crcTRP was implemented and worked out a set of clinic-genomic relations, linking clinical data with genomic data. These relations have also been applied to crcTRP to make it more conductive for cancer translational research.

  Title: Bioinformatics for personal genome interpretation
  Abstract: An international consortium released the first draft sequence of the human genome 10 years ago. Although the analysis of this data has suggested the genetic underpinnings of many diseases, we have not yet been able to fully quantify the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Thus, a major current effort of the scientific community focuses on evaluating individual predispositions to specific phenotypic traits given their genetic backgrounds. Many resources aim to identify and annotate the specific genes responsible for the observed phenotypes. Some of these use intra-species genetic variability as a means for better understanding this relationship. In addition, several online resources are now dedicated to collecting single nucleotide variants and other types of variants, and annotating their functional effects and associations with phenotypic traits. This information has enabled researchers to develop bioinformatics tools to analyze the rapidly increasing amount of newly extracted variation data and to predict the effect of uncharacterized variants. In this work, we review the most important developments in the field—the databases and bioinformatics tools that will be of utmost importance in our concerted effort to interpret the human variome.

  Title: An ontology-based comparative anatomy information system
  Abstract: Introduction: This paper describes the design, implementation, and potential use of a comparative anatomy information system (CAIS) for querying on similarities and differences between homologous anatomical structures across species, the knowledge base it operates upon, the method it uses for determining the answers to the queries, and the user interface it employs to present the results. The relevant informatics contributions of our work include (1) the development and application of the structural difference method, a formalism for symbolically representing anatomical similarities and differences across species; (2) the design of the structure of a mapping between the anatomical models of two different species and its application to information about specific structures in humans, mice, and rats; and (3) the design of the internal syntax and semantics of the query language. These contributions provide the foundation for the development of a working system that allows users to submit queries about the similarities and differences between mouse, rat, and human anatomy; delivers result sets that describe those similarities and differences in symbolic terms; and serves as a prototype for the extension of the knowledge base to any number of species. Additionally, we expanded the domain knowledge by identifying medically relevant structural questions for the human, the mouse, and the rat, and made an initial foray into the validation of the application and its content by means of user questionnaires, software testing, and other feedback. Methods: The anatomical structures of the species to be compared, as well as the mappings between species, are modeled on templates from the Foundational Model of Anatomy knowledge base, and compared using graph-matching techniques. A graphical user interface allows users to issue queries that retrieve information concerning similarities and differences between structures in the species being examined. Queries from diverse information sources, including domain experts, peer-reviewed articles, and reference books, have been used to test the system and to illustrate its potential use in comparative anatomy studies. Results: 157 test queries were submitted to the CAIS system, and all of them were correctly answered. The interface was evaluated in terms of clarity and ease of use. This testing determined that the application works well, and is fairly intuitive to use, but users want to see more clarification of the meaning of the different types of possible queries. Some of the interface issues will naturally be resolved as we refine our conceptual model to deal with partial and complex homologies in the content. Conclusions: The CAIS system and its associated methods are expected to be useful to biologists and translational medicine researchers. Possible applications range from supporting theoretical work in clarifying and modeling ontogenetic, physiological, pathological, and evolutionary transformations, to concrete techniques for improving the analysis of genotype-phenotype relationships among various animal models in support of a wide array of clinical and scientific initiatives.

  Title: Power management subsystem with bi-directional DC to DC converter for μ-power biomedical applications
  Abstract: This paper presents a power management subsystem for μ-power biomedical applications. The power management subsystem is embedded in a wireless sensor SoC that requires 1.5V to operate, with the exception of the sensor bias and RF transmitter which require 3V. The proposed power management block can accept a 3V coin cell or 1.5V button cell battery to operate the entire IC. A bi-directional DC/DC converter is implemented such that 3V can be generated from a 1.5V battery, or, alternately, a 1.5V power supply, can be generated from a 3V battery. When using a 1.5V battery the forward mode DC/DC converter generates a 3V supply with 97% efficiency, while in the reverse mode the 3V supply generates a 1.5V supply with 95% efficiency. The circuit is specially designed to be highly efficient with micro-power loads up to 60µW. The power management circuit is comprised of a bi-directional DC/DC converter or Charge Pump, Charge Pump Startup Circuit, Real Time Clock (RTC), Power On reset (POR), micro power bandgap, analog temperature circuit, 6 degree C temperature comparator, LDO, ADC reference and sensor reference. The circuit is fabricated in a 0.35µm BCD technology and occupies an area of 1.125 mm 2 .

  Title: Automated identification of sleep states from EEG signals by means of ensemble empirical mode decomposition and random under sampling boosting
  Abstract: Background and objective: Automatic sleep staging is essential for alleviating the burden of the physicians of analyzing a large volume of data by visual inspection. It is also a precondition for making an automated sleep monitoring system feasible. Further, computerized sleep scoring will expedite large-scale data analysis in sleep research. Nevertheless, most of the existing works on sleep staging are either multichannel or multiple physiological signal based which are uncomfortable for the user and hinder the feasibility of an in-home sleep monitoring device. So, a successful and reliable computer-assisted sleep staging scheme is yet to emerge.#R##N##R##N#Methods: In this work, we propose a single channel EEG based algorithm for computerized sleep scoring. In the proposed algorithm, we decompose EEG signal segments using Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and extract various statistical moment based features. The effectiveness of EEMD and statistical features are investigated. Statistical analysis is performed for feature selection. A newly proposed classification technique, namely – Random under sampling boosting (RUSBoost) is introduced for sleep stage classification. This is the first implementation of EEMD in conjunction with RUSBoost to the best of the authors’ knowledge. The proposed feature extraction scheme’s performance is investigated for various choices of classification models. The algorithmic performance of our scheme is evaluated against contemporary works in the literature.#R##N##R##N#Results: The performance of the proposed method is comparable or better than that of the state-of-the-art ones. The proposed algorithm gives 88.07%, 83.49%, 92.66%, 94.23%, and 98.15% for 6-state to 2-state classification of sleep stages on Sleep-EDF database. Our experimental outcomes reveal that RUSBoost outperforms other classification models for the feature extraction framework presented in this work. Besides, the algorithm proposed in this work demonstrates high detection accuracy for the sleep states S1 and REM.#R##N##R##N#Conclusion: Statistical moment based features in the EEMD domain distinguish the sleep states successfully and efficaciously. The automated sleep scoring scheme propounded herein can eradicate the onus of the clinicians, contribute to the device implementation of a sleep monitoring system, and benefit sleep research.

  Abstract: Wireless body area networks (WBANs) are important branches of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). They promise unobtrusive ambulatory health monitoring for real-time updates of patients' medical records that have aroused extensive attention in various fields. In recent years, one can find a lot of researches related to WBANs that have appeared in these literatures. But there are still many key issues that need to be further investigated. This paper briefly introduces the architecture and features of WBANs. In this attempt, we focus mostly on energy acquisition, data integration and data sharing, and collaboration of WBANs, from the viewpoint of energy harvesting development, the social network and smartphone application in WBANs, and the integration of WBANs and cloud system networks computing to analyze related issues of WBANs. Finally, we put forward concluding remarks with several future research directions.

  Title: Poster abstract: Accurate monitoring of circardian rhythms using wearable Body Sensor Networks
  Abstract: Monitoring the impact of sleep deprivation on thermoregulation requires a careful measurement of skin temperature across the human body to have precise knowledge and understanding of the stability of circadian rhythms, the 24-hour cycles of biological activity. However, medical measurements and clinical trials are often carried out in controlled lab settings, which limits the realism and the duration of data collections, and increases significantly their costs. We aim to provide medical researchers studying the stability of the circadian rhythms with a tool for higher quality data collections. We design and develop a wireless unobtrusive monitoring system for accurate body temperature measurements to be worn by patients for several weeks while they live their normal life. Obtaining a long-lasting highly-accurate measurement system is challenging, as energy and computational resources are severely constrained in miniaturized wearable sensor nodes. We develop a prototype of an active temperature measurement system with 0.02°C accuracy, a lifetime of up to 3 weeks, and real-time feedback to a remote medic. Our preliminary experiments show that we can identify the circadian rhythms also in non-ambulatory environments, indicating that our tool could become a valuable asset for medical research.

  Title: Energy minimization and reliability for wearable medical applications
  Abstract: Wearable medical systems, which are used for medical monitoring, assessment, and/or treatment have the essential requirements to be low energy consuming and reliable. They must be energy efficient, so that battery size is minimal, to ensure that the systems are convenient to use. Also, they must be highly reliable, because they are being developed for critical medical applications. In this paper, we examine the critical requirement of energy minimization, specifically for wearable medical systems. We present an overview of the general power management schemes, along with more specific approaches tailored to wearable systems. We specifically highlight two medical wearable systems, RFAB and CustoMed, being developed by our group. Finally, we discuss the relationship between reliability and power management, and how this impacts the critical medical systems we are examining.

  Title: Wireless Implantable Electronic Platform for Chronic Fluorescent-Based Biosensors
  Abstract: The development of a long-term wireless implantable biosensor based on fluorescence intensity measurement poses a number of technical challenges, ranging from biocompatibility to sensor stability over time. One of these challenges is the design of a power efficient and miniaturized electronics, enabling the biosensor to move from bench testing to long term validation, up to its final application in human beings. In this spirit, we present a wireless programmable electronic platform for implantable chronic monitoring of fluorescent-based autonomous biosensors. This system is able to achieve extremely low power operation with bidirectional telemetry, based on the IEEE802.15.4-2003 protocol, thus enabling over three-year battery lifetime and wireless networking of multiple sensors. During the performance of single fluorescent-based sensor measurements, the circuit drives a laser diode, for sensor excitation, and acquires the amplified signals from four different photodetectors. In vitro functionality was preliminarily tested for both glucose and calcium monitoring, simply by changing the analyte-binding protein of the biosensor. Electronics performance was assessed in terms of timing, power consumption, tissue exposure to electromagnetic fields, and in vivo wireless connectivity. The final goal of the presented platform is to be integrated in a complete system for blood glucose level monitoring that may be implanted for at least one year under the skin of diabetic patients. Results reported in this paper may be applied to a wide variety of biosensors based on fluorescence intensity measurement.

  Title: A high-energy-efficiency link scheme for closed-loop medical monitoring and intervention
  Abstract: A high-energy-efficiency wireless communication link scheme is proposed for portable medical applications with strict resource constraints. The scheme is especially optimized for the application systems with the star-topology master-slave network, i.e., the network formed by a portable data-logger (master) and several sensor nodes (slaves). The proposed scheme eliminates “non-effective” operation energy consumption in the power-critical slave nodes, by means of “moving” the energy-hungry operations to the master node. Compared to the conventional protocols, the proposed scheme can greatly save energy and lengthen the lifetime of the slave nodes which are usually supplied by miniature button batteries, with the cost of affordable extra power consumption in the master node. The prototype verification shows that energy efficiency and lifetime can be improved by at least 50% for slave sensor nodes with a typical operation duty cycle.

  Title: Wireless wearable photoplethysmography sensors for continuous blood pressure monitoring
  Abstract: Blood Pressure (BP) is a crucial vital sign taken into consideration for the general assessment of patient’s condition: patients with hypertension or hypotension are advised to record their BP routinely. Particularly, hypertension is emphasized by stress, diabetic neuropathy and coronary heart diseases and could lead to stroke. Therefore, routine and long-term monitoring can enable early detection of symptoms and prevent life-threatening events. The gold standard method for measuring BP is the use of a stethoscope and sphygmomanometer to detect systolic and diastolic pressures. However, only discrete measurements are taken. To enable pervasive and continuous monitoring of BP, recent methods have been proposed: pulse arrival time (PAT) or PAT difference (PATD) between different body parts are based on the combination of electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors. Nevertheless, this technique could be quite obtrusive as in addition to at least two contacts/electrodes to measure the differential voltage across the left arm/leg/chest and the right arm/leg/chest, ECG measurements are easily corrupted by motion artefacts. Although such devices are small, wearable and relatively convenient to use, most devices are not designed for continuous BP measurements. This paper introduces a novel PPG-based pervasive sensing platform for continuous measurements of BP. Based on the principle of using PAT to estimate BP, two PPG sensors are used to measure the PATD between the earlobe and the wrist to measure BP. The device is compared with a gold standard PPG sensor and validation of the concept is conducted with a preliminary study involving 9 healthy subjects. Results show that the mean BP and PATD are correlated with a 0.3 factor. This preliminary study shows the feasibility of continuous monitoring of BP using a pair of PPG placed on the ear lobe and wrist with PATD measurements is possible.

  Abstract: Data mining techniques often ask for the resolution of optimization problems. Supervised classification, and, in particular, support vector machines, can be seen as a paradigmatic instance. In this paper, some links between mathematical optimization methods and supervised classification are emphasized. It is shown that many different areas of mathematical optimization play a central role in off-the-shelf supervised classification methods. Moreover, mathematical optimization turns out to be extremely useful to address important issues in classification, such as identifying relevant variables, improving the interpretability of classifiers or dealing with vagueness/noise in the data.

  Title: Learning Parameterized Skills
  Abstract: We introduce a method for constructing skills capable of solving tasks drawn from a distribution of parameterized reinforcement learning problems. The method draws example tasks from a distribution of interest and uses the corresponding learned policies to estimate the topology of the lower-dimensional piecewise-smooth manifold on which the skill policies lie. This manifold models how policy parameters change as task parameters vary. The method identies the number of charts that compose the manifold and then applies non-linear regression in each chart to construct a parameterized skill by predicting policy parameters from task parameters. We evaluate our method on an underactuated simulated robotic arm tasked with learning to accurately throw darts at a parameterized target location.

  Title: A Decade of Kasabov's Evolving Connectionist Systems: A Review
  Abstract: Evolving connectionist systems (ECoSs) are a family of constructive artificial neural network algorithms that were first proposed by Kasabov in 1998, where ldquoevolvingrdquo in this context means ldquochanging over time,rdquo rather than evolving through simulated evolution. A decade on the number of ECoS algorithms and the problems to which they have been applied have multiplied. This paper reviews the current state of the art in the field of ECoS networks via a substantial literature review. It reviews: (1) the motivations for ECoS; (2) the major ECoS algorithms in use; (3) previously existing constructive algorithms that are similar to ECoS; (4) empirical evaluations of ECoS networks over benchmark datasets; and (5) applications of ECoS to real-world problems. The paper ends with some suggestions of future directions of research into ECoS networks.

  Title: Survey of Model-Based Reinforcement Learning: Applications on Robotics
  Abstract: Reinforcement learning is an appealing approach for allowing robots to learn new tasks. Relevant literature reveals a plethora of methods, but at the same time makes clear the lack of implementations for dealing with real life challenges. Current expectations raise the demand for adaptable robots. We argue that, by employing model-based reinforcement learning, the—now limited—adaptability characteristics of robotic systems can be expanded. Also, model-based reinforcement learning exhibits advantages that makes it more applicable to real life use-cases compared to model-free methods. Thus, in this survey, model-based methods that have been applied in robotics are covered. We categorize them based on the derivation of an optimal policy, the definition of the returns function, the type of the transition model and the learned task. Finally, we discuss the applicability of model-based reinforcement learning approaches in new applications, taking into consideration the state of the art in both algorithms and hardware.

  Title: Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Kidney Transplant Recipients Using Profiled Support Vector Machines
  Abstract: This paper proposes a twofold approach for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of kidney recipients using support vector machines (SVMs), for both predicting and detecting Cyclosporine A (CyA) blood concentrations. The final goal is to build useful, robust, and ultimately understandable models for individualizing the dosage of CyA. We compare SVMs with several neural network models, such as the multilayer perceptron (MLP), the Elman recurrent network, finite/infinite impulse response networks, and neural network ARMAX approaches. In addition, we present a profile-dependent SVM (PD-SVM), which incorporates a priori knowledge in both tasks. Models are compared numerically, statistically, and in the presence of additive noise. Data from 57 renal allograft recipients were used to develop the models. Patients followed a standard triple therapy, and CyA trough concentration was the dependent variable. The best results for the CyA blood concentration prediction were obtained using the PD-SVM (mean error of 0.36 ng/mL and root-mean-square error of 52.01 ng/mL in the validation set) and appeared to be more robust in the presence of additive noise. The proposed PD-SVM improved results from the standard SVM and MLP, specially significant (both numerical and statistically) in the one-against-all scheme. Finally, some clinical conclusions were obtained from sensitivity rankings of the models and distribution of support vectors. We conclude that the PD-SVM approach produces more accurate and robust models than do neural networks. Finally, a software tool for aiding medical decision-making including the prediction models is presented

  Title: Simultaneous discovery of multiple alternative optimal policies by reinforcement learning
  Abstract: Conventional reinforcement learning algorithms for direct policy search are limited to finding only a single optimal policy. This is caused by their local-search nature, which allows them to converge only to a single local optimum in policy space, and makes them heavily dependent on the policy initialization. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning algorithm for direct policy search, which is capable of simultaneously finding multiple alternative optimal policies. The algorithm is based on particle filtering and performs global search in policy space, therefore eliminating the dependency on the policy initialization, and having the ability to find the globally optimal policy. We validate the approach on one- and two-dimensional problems with multiple optima, and compare its performance to a global random sampling method, and a state-of-the-art Expectation-Maximization based reinforcement learning algorithm.
