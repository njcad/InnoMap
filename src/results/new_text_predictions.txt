  Title: Multisensor background extraction and updating for moving target detection
  Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for multisensor background extraction and updating aimed at surveillance and target detection applications. The background scene extraction is based on robust multisensor change detection of moving objects in the scene. An iterative mechanism updates the background estimate using this information thereby ignoring transient objects but allowing for slow changes in scene illumination. A new multisensor confidence framework is proposed that combines change information from all available sensors to greatly improve the reliability of true scene change detection therefore the reliability of the background image estimate. The proposed method is demonstrated on several sets of registered multisensor images.

  Title: Rule-Based Support Vector Machine Classifiers Applied to Tornado Prediction
  Abstract: A rule-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is applied to tornado prediction. Twenty rules based on the National Severe Storms Laboratory's mesoscale detection algorithm are used along with SVM to develop a hybrid forecast system for the discrimination of tornadic from non- tornadic events. The use of the Weather Surveillance Radar 1998 Doppler data, with continuous data streaming in every six minutes, presents a source for a dynamic data driven application system. Scientific inquiries based on these data are useful for dynamic data driven application systems (DDDAS). Sensitivity analysis is performed by changing the threshold values of the rules. Numerical results show that the optimal hybrid model outperforms the direct application of SVM by 12.7 percent.

  Title: E-FallD: A fall detection system using android-based smartphone
  Abstract: With the rapid growth of the population of the elderly in the world, many countries in the world have been in the aging society. Falls are a major public health concern and one of the greatest obstacles to independent living for elder adults in terms of social services. In this paper, we present a fall detection system derived from some motion sensor via an android-based smart phone in which we utilize adaptive threshold algorithm for fall detection. Furthermore, we implement this system called E-FallD on the HTC G8 mobile phone. As demonstrated by the experimental results, E-FallD has a good detection performance and it is an efficient and smart application. In the mean time, using adaptive threshold algorithm could increase sensitivity dramatically. In a word ,our system provides a realizable, effective and portal solution to fall detection for users.

  Title: SAM - An Interoperable Metadata Model for Multimodal Surveillance Applications
  Abstract: Metadata interoperability is crucial for various kinds of surveillance applications and systems, e.g. metadata mining in multi-sensor environments, metadata exchange in networked camera systems or information fusion in multi-sensor and multi-detector environments. Different metadata formats have been proposed to foster metadata interoperability, but they show significant limitations. ViPER, CVML and MPEG Visual Surveillance MAF support only the visual modality, CVML's frame based approach leads to inefficient representation, and MPEG-7's comprehensiveness handicaps its efficient usage for a specific application. To overcome these limitations we propose the Surveillance Application Metadata (SAM) model, capable of describing online and offline analysis results as a set of time lines containing events. A set of sensors, detectors, recorded media items and object instances is described centrally and linked from the event descriptions. The time lines can be related to a subset of sensors and detectors for any modality and different levels of abstraction. Hierarchical classification schemes are used for many purposes, such as types of properties and their values, event types, object classes, coordinate systems etc. in order to allow for application specific adaptations without modifying the data model while ensuring the controlled use of terms. The model supports efficient representation of dense spatio-temporal information such as object trajectories. SAM is not bound to a specific serialization but can be mapped to different existing formats within the limitations evoked by the target format. SAM specifications and examples have been made available.

  Title: From Remotely Sensed Vegetation Onset to Sowing Dates: Aggregating Pixel-Level Detections into Village-Level Sowing Probabilities
  Abstract: Monitoring the start of the crop season in Sahel provides decision makers with valuable information for an early assessment of potential production and food security threats. Presently, the most common method for the estimation of sowing dates in West African countries consists of applying given thresholds on rainfall estimations. However, the coarse spatial resolution and the possible inaccuracy of these estimations are limiting factors. In this context, the remote sensing approach, which consists of deriving green-up onset dates from satellite remote sensing data, appears as an interesting alternative. It builds upon a novel statistic model that translates vegetation onset detections derived from MODIS time series into sowing probabilities at the village level. Results for Niger show that this approach outperforms the standard method adopted in the region based on rainfall thresholds.

  Title: People reidentification in surveillance and forensics: A survey
  Abstract: The field of surveillance and forensics research is currently shifting focus and is now showing an ever increasing interest in the task of people reidentification. This is the task of assigning the same identifier to all instances of a particular individual captured in a series of images or videos, even after the occurrence of significant gaps over time or space. People reidentification can be a useful tool for people analysis in security as a data association method for long-term tracking in surveillance. However, current identification techniques being utilized present many difficulties and shortcomings. For instance, they rely solely on the exploitation of visual cues such as color, texture, and the object’s shape. Despite the many advances in this field, reidentification is still an open problem. This survey aims to tackle all the issues and challenging aspects of people reidentification while simultaneously describing the previously proposed solutions for the encountered problems. This begins with the first attempts of holistic descriptors and progresses to the more recently adopted 2D and 3D model-based approaches. The survey also includes an exhaustive treatise of all the aspects of people reidentification, including available datasets, evaluation metrics, and benchmarking.

  Title: Classification of multisource and hyperspectral data based on decision fusion
  Abstract: Multisource classification methods based on neural networks and statistical modeling are considered. For these methods, the individual data sources are at first treated separately and modeled by statistical methods. Then several decision fusion schemes are applied to combine the information from the individual data sources. These schemes include weighted consensus theory where the weights of the individual data sources reflect the reliability of the sources. The weights are optimized in order to improve the combined classification accuracies. Other considered decision fusion schemes are based on two-stage approaches which use voting in the first stage and reject samples if either the majority or all of the classifiers for the data sources do not agree on a classification of a sample. For the second stage, a neural network is used to classify the rejected samples. The proposed methods are applied in the classification of multisource and hyperdimensional data sets, and the results compared to accuracies obtained with conventional classification schemes.

  Title: Online Change Detection Algorithm for Noisy Time-Series: An Application Tonear-Real Time Burned Area Mapping
  Abstract: Lack of the global knowledge of land-cover changes limits our understanding of the earth system, hinders natural resource management and also compounds risks. Remote sensing data provides an opportunity to automatically detect and monitor land-cover changes. Although changes in land cover can be observed from remote sensing time series, most traditional change point detection algorithms do not perform well due to the unique properties of the remote sensing data, such as noise, missing values and seasonality. We propose an online change point detection method that addresses these challenges. Using an independent validation set, we show that the proposed method performs better than the four baseline methods in both of the two testing regions, which has ecologically diverse features.

  Title: Real-time energy-efficient fall detection based on SSR energy efficiency strategy
  Abstract: Falling of the elderly has become a growing concern of the community due to the increase of the ageing population and the serious consequences caused by falling. Devising a fall detection system that is not only highly accurate and reliable, but energy efficient and durable is a challenge. In this paper, we proposed an energy efficient fall detection algorithm based on segmented sampling rates. Most of the time, the algorithm uses a low sampling rate to minimise the energy consumption, but a higher sampling rate when a possible fall is sensed. This unique design helps to increase the fall detection accuracy, while reducing the total energy consumption. Results of comprehensive performance evaluation show that the accuracy rate of the proposed fall detection algorithm is 98.33%, meanwhile, the system can save energy by 9.13% comparing to other algorithms running with a high sampling rate without an energy efficient strategy.

  Title: Miniature in vivo Robots for Remote and Harsh Environments
  Abstract: Long-term human space exploration will require contingencies for emergency medical procedures including some capability to perform surgery. The ability to perform minimally invasive surgery (MIS) would be an important capability. The use of small incisions reduces surgical risk, but also eliminates the ability of the surgeon to view and touch the surgical environment directly. Robotic surgery, or telerobotic surgery, may provide emergency surgical care in remote or harsh environments such as space flight, or extremely forward environments such as battlefields. However, because current surgical robots are large and require extensive support personnel, their implementation has remained limited in forward environments, and they would be difficult, or impossible, to use in space flight or on battlefields. This paper presents experimental analysis of miniature fixed-base and mobile in vivo robots to support MIS surgery in remote and harsh environments. The objective is to develop wireless imaging and task-assisting robots that can be placed inside the abdominal cavity during surgery. Such robots will provide surgical task assistance and enable an on-site or remote surgeon to view the surgical environment from multiple angles. This approach is applicable to long-duration space flight, battlefield situations, and for traditional medical centers and other remote surgical locations.

  Title: Application of sensing techniques to cellular force measurement.
  Abstract: Cell traction forces (CTFs) are the forces produced by cells and exerted on extracellular matrix or an underlying substrate. CTFs function to maintain cell shape, enable cell migration, and generate and detect mechanical signals. As such, they play a vital role in many fundamental biological processes, including angiogenesis, inflammation, and wound healing. Therefore, a close examination of CTFs can enable better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of such processes. To this end, various force-sensing techniques for CTF measurement have been developed over the years. This article will provide a concise review of these sensing techniques and comment on the needs for improved force-sensing technologies for cell mechanics and biology research.

  Title: Scalable Distributed Protocol for Modular Micro-Robots Network Reorganization
  Abstract: The programmable material is one of the most challenging problems in micro-robot networking. In addition to the problems that arise by the miniaturization of millimeter-scale mobile devices, the conception of the distributed asynchronous algorithms allowing the coordination of large number of robots remains a very complex task. Micro-robot network represents one of the implementations of the Internet of things, where a set of micro-robots react to an order submitted on a wireless downlink channel specifying a global goal. This goal corresponds to a target shape in the case of shape-shifting problem. Programmable materials have many applications in the field of paintable displays, prototyping, locomotion, etc. We propose in this paper an original flexible distributed algorithm allowing to reorganize a modular micro-robot network into a desired target shape (physical topology). The efficiency of such an algorithm is assessed on the basis of the memory requirements, the communication load, and the number of performed movements to reach the final shape. The proposed algorithm shows a great flexibility concerning the range of target shapes that can be achieved, in part because there is no need for an explicit description of the final shape. To assess the computational performances of the presented algorithm, we proposed a linear programming model of the shape-shifting problem that provides a lower bound of optimized criteria. The comparison of our results with those given by the relaxed linear programming proves the efficiency of our approach.

  Title: Minimum-Time Optimal Control of Many Robots that Move in the Same Direction at Different Speeds
  Abstract: In this paper, we solve the minimum-time optimal control problem for a group of robots that can move at different speeds but that must all move in the same direction. We are motivated to solve this problem because constraints of this sort are common in micro-scale and nano-scale robotic systems. By application of the minimum principle, we obtain necessary conditions for optimality and use them to guess a candidate control policy. By showing that the corresponding value function is a viscosity solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, we verify that our guess is optimal. The complexity of finding this policy for arbitrary initial conditions is only quasilinear in the number of robots, and in fact is dominated by the computation of a planar convex hull. We extend this result to consider obstacle avoidance by explicit parameterization of all possible optimal control policies, and show examples in simulation.

  Title: Micromanipulation, communication and swarm intelligence issues in a swarm microrobotic platform
  Abstract: Rapid advancements of both microsystem technology and multi-agent systems have generated a new discipline, arising from the fusion of microrobotics technologies and of swarm intelligence theories. Microrobotics contributes with new capabilities in manipulating objects in the microscale and in developing miniaturized intelligent machines, while swarm intelligence supplies new algorithms allowing sets of simple robotic agents to solve complex tasks. A microrobotic swarm that is able to collectively achieve a cleaning task in an arena has been developed. This paper presents a novel platform for microrobotic swarms with the goal to apply swarm intelligence results to practical micromanipulation tasks and describes in details two main features of the platform: an optical communication strategy between the microrobotic agents, in order to share information and to coordinate swarm actions, and a micromanipulation technique ‐ based on electrostatic phenomena ‐ which can be performed by each microrobotic agent. c 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  Title: New catheter driving method using linear stepping mechanism for intravascular neurosurgery
  Abstract: Minimum invasive surgery that supports doctors and reduces patient's physical pain has attracted attention. We consider a new intravascular neurosurgery system. There are two problems in intravascular neurosurgery: one is doctor's exposure to x-ray, and another is the lack of skilled doctors. We developed a remote control system by using a master-slave system to solve these problems. In this paper, we describe the development of a new slave device in the master-slave system and construct the new remote control system of catheter operation with safety. To overcome some of the problems encountered on the previous slave device (2000), we develop a new slave device with a disposable structure employing the mechanism of a mechanical pencil for safe operation.

  Title: Insertable surgical imaging device with pan, tilt, zoom, and lighting
  Abstract: This paper describes work we have done in developing an insertable surgical imaging device with multiple degrees-of-freedom for minimally invasive surgery. The device is fully insertable into the abdomen using standard 12 mm trocars. It consists of a modular camera and lens system which has pan and tilt capability provided by 2 small DC servo motors. It also has its own integrated lighting system that is part of the camera assembly. Once the camera is inserted into the abdomen, the insertion port is available for additional tooling, motivating the idea of single port surgery. A third zoom axis has been designed for the camera as well, allowing close-up and far-away imaging of surgical sites with a single camera unit. In animal tests with the device we have performed surgical procedures including cholecystectomy, appendectomy, running (measuring) the bowel, suturing, and nephrectomy. The tests show that the new device is: (1) Easier and more intuitive to use than a standard laparoscope. (2) Joystick operation requires no specialized operator training. (3) Field of view and access to relevant regions of the body were superior to a standard laparoscope using a single port. (4) Time to perform procedures was better or equivalent to a standard laparoscope. We believe these insertable platforms will be an integral part of future surgical systems. The platforms can be used with tooling as well as imaging systems, allowing many surgical procedures to be done using such a platform.

  Title: Capsular microrobot using directional friction spiral
  Abstract: Most researches on internal mobile robot are going on based on the invasive clamping functions which generate the propulsion through a direct contact with organic tubes. This paper proposes a novel locomotion mechanism, which moves fundamentally based on a spiral profile and generates the additional force by transferring the rotational movement to the linear movement. The essence of proposed mobile microrobot is development of a rotation-linear movement interface mechanism and a non-invasive clamping function. This paper introduces the working principle and analyzes the behavior of mobile robot. Finally we validate the performance of robot as non-invasive locomotion mechanism by experiments.

  Title: The marionette bed: automated rolling and repositioning of bedridden patients
  Abstract: A design for rolling and repositioning a bedridden patient is presented. A pair of actuated rollers are attached to both sides of the bedsheet in order to lift and manipulate the patient body, like a marionette. The patient is gently supported on a hammock-like active bedsheet, creating virtually no shear forces on the patient body. Therefore, the patient can safely and easily be maneuvered with minimal physical assistance! by the caregiver. This prevents development of painful bedsores and of pneumonia. In the paper, functional requirements and design issues are addressed, followed by the basic design concept, mechanism, and control strategy. A prototype is built and initial experiments demonstrate that a human body is rolled and manipulated by the marionette device, providing proof of concept. A simple kinematic model is built to create trajectories for generation of desired body motion. Extended functionalities including bed-to-chair and bed-to-bed transfers, are described at the end.

  Title: Analysis and Experiments on the Force Capabilities of Centripetal-Force-Actuated Microrobotic Platforms
  Abstract: This paper studies the capabilities of a microrobotic platform, driven by vibrating motors, to generate and impart micromanipulation forces of desired type and magnitude. First, an analysis is carried out on the nature of the actuation forces of the motion mechanism of the platform. The results demonstrate that the oscillating nature of these forces does not allow their direct use for micromanipulations. Consequently, further analysis is conducted to identify the conditions, under which the platform's actuation forces can be exploited for micromanipulations. To this end, a dynamic model of a single-dimensional pushing operation is developed, comprising the dynamics of the platform, the manipulator and the object. It is demonstrated by simulation that the forces imparted on the manipulated object depend on the physical parameters of the platform-manipulator system. Accordingly, a set of nonlinear equations involving platform-manipulator system parameters, is formulated that describes the conditions for developing micromanipulation forces of appropriate type and magnitude. The solution of this set of equations yields a range of parameter values, which are used as guidelines in the design and construction of a manipulator that is capable of applying smooth and controllable forces to manipulated objects. Using the parameter values suggested by the developed analysis, a needle type manipulator, appropriate for force feedback applications, is designed, built, and mounted on an experimental prototype of the microrobotic platform. Using this manipulator, experiments demonstrate the force capabilities of the microrobotic platform and verified the analytical and simulation results.

  Title: crcTRP: a translational research platform for colorectal cancer.
  Abstract: Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality in both developed and developing countries. Transforming basic research results into clinical practice is one of the key tasks of translational research, which will greatly improve the diagnosis and treatments of colorectal cancer. In this paper, a translational research platform for colorectal cancer, named crcTRP, is introduced. crcTRP serves the colorectal cancer translational research by providing various types of biomedical information related with colorectal cancer to the community. The information, including clinical data, epidemiology data, individual omics data, and public omics data, was collected through a multisource biomedical information collection solution and then integrated in a clinic-omics database, which was constructed with EAV-ER model for flexibility and efficiency. A preliminary exploration of conducting translational research on crcTRP was implemented and worked out a set of clinic-genomic relations, linking clinical data with genomic data. These relations have also been applied to crcTRP to make it more conductive for cancer translational research.

  Title: Genetics-based machine learning for the assessment of certain neuromuscular disorders
  Abstract: Clinical electromyography (EMG) provides useful information for the diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders. The utility of artificial neural networks (ANN's) in classifying EMG data trained with backpropagation or Rohonen's self-organizing feature maps algorithm has recently been demonstrated. The objective of this study is to investigate how genetics-based machine learning (GBML) can be applied for diagnosing certain neuromuscular disorders based on EMG data. The effect of GBML control parameters on diagnostic performance is also examined. A hybrid diagnostic system is introduced that combines both neural network and GBML models. Such a hybrid system provides the end-user with a robust and reliable system, as its diagnostic performance relies on more than one learning principle. GBML models demonstrated similar performance to neural-network models, but with less computation. The diagnostic performance of neural network and GBML models is enhanced by the hybrid system.

  Title: Developing knowledge resources to support precision medicine: Principles from the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)
  Abstract: To move beyond a select few genes/drugs, the successful adoption of pharmacogenomics into routine clinical care requires a curated and machine-readable database of pharmacogenomic knowledge suitable for use in an electronic health record (EHR) with clinical decision support (CDS). Recognizing that EHR vendors do not yet provide a standard set of CDS functions for pharmacogenetics, the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) Informatics Working Group is developing and systematically incorporating a set of EHR-agnostic implementation resources into all CPIC guidelines. These resources illustrate how to integrate pharmacogenomic test results in clinical information systems with CDS to facilitate the use of patient genomic data at the point of care. Based on our collective experience creating existing CPIC resources and implementing pharmacogenomics at our practice sites, we outline principles to define the key features of future knowledge bases and discuss the importance of these knowledge resources for pharmacogenomics and ultimately precision medicine.

  Abstract: Interaction sites on protein surfaces mediate virtually all biological activities, and their identification holds promise for disease treatment and drug design. Novel algorithmic approaches for the prediction of these sites have been produced at a rapid rate, and the field has seen significant advancement over the past decade. However, the most current methods have not yet been reviewed in a systematic and comprehensive fashion. Herein, we describe the intricacies of the biological theory, datasets, and features required for modern protein-protein interaction site (PPIS) prediction, and present an integrative analysis of the state-of-the-art algorithms and their performance. First, the major sources of data used by predictors are reviewed, including training sets, evaluation sets, and methods for their procurement. Then, the features employed and their importance in the biological characterization of PPISs are explored. This is followed by a discussion of the methodologies adopted in contemporary prediction programs, as well as their relative performance on the datasets most recently used for evaluation. In addition, the potential utility that PPIS identification holds for rational drug design, hotspot prediction, and computational molecular docking is described. Finally, an analysis of the most promising areas for future development of the field is presented.

  Title: Similarity-based algorithms for Disease Terminology Mapping
  Abstract: Classification of diseases and their related terms are important data resources for basic medical research. However, disease terms in different terminological databases are largely developed independent of each other and the mapping relationships between them are not complete. The purpose of this paper is to propose similarity-based disease terminology mapping methods to map disease terms with same or similar semantic concepts in different terminological databases. By integrating the bibliographic medical records from PubMed and the manually curated associations of disease-gene and disease-phenotype, we proposed two methods, namely Semantic-based Similarity for Disease Terminology Mapping (SSDTM) and Information Recommend-based Disease Terminology Mapping (IRDTM) to predict the disease terms in OMIM to MeSH. The experimental results show that both methods can support predicting mapping between disease databases. From leave one out cross validation, the prediction performance of SSDTM (Hits@10: 87.3%) is better than IRDTM; From manual evaluation, the hits rate in top 10 of SSDTM is 94.4%. The similarity-based disease terminology mapping method can be applied with the supplement of manual review for different mainstream disease terminology databases and help improve the efficiency of integrated medical ontology development and translational bioinformatics that need incorporate multiple data sources from different disciplines.

  Title: Wearable Monitoring of Physical Functioning and Disability Changes, Circadian Rhythms and Sleep Patterns in Nursing Home Residents
  Abstract: Sleep problems and disrupted circadian rhythms are common among older adults and may be associated with several health issues and physical functioning status. Wearable continuous monitoring of physical activity enables unobtrusive monitoring of circadian activity and sleep patterns. The objective of this retrospective study was to analyze whether physical functioning status (Activities of Daily Living assessment of Resident Assessment Instrument) is associated with diurnal activity rhythm and sleep patterns measured with wearable activity sensor in nursing home residents during their normal daily life. Continuous activity data were collected by the wearable sensor from 16 nursing home residents (average age of 90.7 years, seven demented subjects, one female) in their daily life over several months (12–18 months). The subjects’ physical activity and sleep were quantified by several parameters from the activity data. In the cross-sectional analysis, physical functioning status was associated with the strength (RHO = 0.78,   $P   ) and the stability (RHO = 0.72,   $P   ) of the activity rhythm when the level of dementia was not controlled. In the longitudinal analysis (12–18 months), at an individual level the activity rhythm indices and activity level had the strongest correlations with changes in physical functioning but the associations were to some extent individual. In these long-term case recordings, decrease in the physical functioning was most strongly associated with decreasing levels of activity, stability, and strength of the activity rhythm, and with increasing fragmentation of rhythm and daytime passivity. Daily wearable monitoring of physical activity may hence reveal information about functioning state and health of older adults. However, since the changes in activity patterns implying changes in physical functioning status may not be consistent between the individuals, a multivariate approach is recommended for monitoring of these changes by continuous physical activity measurement.

  Title: Poster abstract: Accurate monitoring of circardian rhythms using wearable Body Sensor Networks
  Abstract: Monitoring the impact of sleep deprivation on thermoregulation requires a careful measurement of skin temperature across the human body to have precise knowledge and understanding of the stability of circadian rhythms, the 24-hour cycles of biological activity. However, medical measurements and clinical trials are often carried out in controlled lab settings, which limits the realism and the duration of data collections, and increases significantly their costs. We aim to provide medical researchers studying the stability of the circadian rhythms with a tool for higher quality data collections. We design and develop a wireless unobtrusive monitoring system for accurate body temperature measurements to be worn by patients for several weeks while they live their normal life. Obtaining a long-lasting highly-accurate measurement system is challenging, as energy and computational resources are severely constrained in miniaturized wearable sensor nodes. We develop a prototype of an active temperature measurement system with 0.02°C accuracy, a lifetime of up to 3 weeks, and real-time feedback to a remote medic. Our preliminary experiments show that we can identify the circadian rhythms also in non-ambulatory environments, indicating that our tool could become a valuable asset for medical research.

  Title: A short review and primer on electrodermal activity in human computer interaction applications
  Abstract: The application of psychophysiological in human-computer interaction is a growing field with significant potential for future smart personalised systems. Working in this emerging field requires comprehension of an array of physiological signals and analysis techniques. #R##N#One of the most widely used signals is electrodermal activity, or EDA, also known as galvanic skin response or GSR. This signal is commonly used as a proxy for physiological arousal, but recent advances of interpretation and analysis suggest that traditional approaches should be revised. We present a short review on the application of EDA in human-computer interaction. #R##N#This paper aims to serve as a primer for the novice, enabling rapid familiarisation with the latest core concepts. We put special emphasis on everyday human-computer interface applications to distinguish from the more common clinical or sports uses of psychophysiology. #R##N#This paper is an extract from a comprehensive review of the entire field of ambulatory psychophysiology, including 12 similar chapters, plus application guidelines and systematic review.

  Title: Evaluation of AllergiSense Smartphone Tools for Adrenaline Injection Training
  Abstract: © 2015 IEEE. Anaphylaxis is an increasingly prevalent life-threatening allergic condition that requires people with anaphylaxis and their caregivers to be trained in the avoidance of allergen triggers and in the administration of adrenaline auto-injectors. The prompt and correct administration of auto-injectors in the event of an anaphylactic reaction is a significant challenge in the management of anaphylaxis. Unfortunately, many people do not know how to use auto-injectors and either fail to use them or fail to use them correctly. This is due in part to deficiencies in training and also to the lack of a system encouraging continuous practice with feedback. Assistive smartphone healthcare technologies have demonstrated potential to support the management of chronic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but there have been deficiencies in their evaluation and there has been a lack of application to anaphylaxis. This paper describes AllergiSense, a smartphone app and sensing system for anaphylaxis management, and presents the results of a randomized, controlled, pre-post evaluation of AllergiSense injection training and feedback tools with healthy participants. Participants whose training was supplemented with AllergiSense injection feedback achieved significantly better practiced injections with 90.5% performing correct injections compared to only 28.6% in the paper-only control group. In addition, the results provide insights into possible self-efficacy failings in traditional training and the benefits of embedding self-efficacy theory into the technology design process.

  Title: A System for Multi-Domain Contextualization of Personal Health Data
  Abstract: Current telehealth systems are used to improve the treatment of chronic diseases by collecting medical data at the patient and transferring them to a remote medical institution. Research shows that such medical practice can be substantially improved if the measured parameters are greater in number and of more diverse nature. Emerging consumer solutions for monitoring personal health and wellness, as well as various resources from domains like internet, telecommunications and smart living, can be used as possible sources for exploration of an individual's wider health context. It was our aim to design an internet of things solutions, which would combine these sources of information into context information, complementary to health data. An internet of things platform was designed and implemented and integration with an established e-health system was provided to enrich telehealth data with context information by aggregating and processing cross-domain inputs from various sources. The approach was validated on a use case scenario. The concept was tried in a scenario related to prevention and management of heart disease. The system's advanced graphic correlation features are expected to help physicians and patients identify true roots of health problems. Medical researchers are also expected to benefit from a deeper insight into complex cross-domain parameter dependencies that determine an individual's health.

  Title: Association between smartphone-based activity monitoring and traditional clinical assessment tools in community-dwelling older people
  Abstract: Smartphones are used in the framework of the FARSEEING-InChianti study to gain information on activities of daily living and define objective physical activity profiles. In this study we aimed to investigate the association between mean and extreme values of physical activity and gait characteristics derived from daily living activities and well-established clinical tools. 171 older adults from the InChianti cohort study were recruited. Factor analysis was performed to extract the underlying structure of physical activity and gait features for both mean and extreme values. Outcomes of the smartphone-based home monitoring are associated with clinical assessments. Extreme values seem to be more informative than the mean values and are more closely related with clinical assessments.

  Title: Challenges in Wearable Devices Based Pervasive Wellbeing Monitoring
  Abstract: This paper presents an open discussion about current achievements and remaining challenges in the general adoption of wearable monitoring devices among the general population. To understand the open issues we present some background of Internet of Things (IoT) systems for pervasive wellbeing monitoring, including a brief taxonomy of wearable monitoring devices and possible application domains. We also classify and explain key possible influencing factors related to use, adherence and attrition in wearable monitoring solutions. Finally, we have conducted a survey where we analyzed the user perspective of long term wearable device usage. We asked about 16 issues, organized in three categories: the practical daily use, data and measurement procedures, and user experience with the device and supporting software. Preliminary findings indicate that most of the issues are perceived as highly relevant or relevant for the users and that roughly half of them have already personally experienced these problems. Based in the findings of the survey we provide some insights about possible solutions.

  Title: HRV4Training: Large-scale longitudinal training load analysis in unconstrained free-living settings using a smartphone application
  Abstract: We describe an approach to support athletes at various fitness levels in their training load analysis using heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV). A smartphone-based application (HRV4Training) was developed that captures heart activity over one to five minutes using photoplethysmography (PPG) and derives HR and HRV features. HRV4Training integrated a guide for an early morning spot measurement protocol and a questionnaire to capture self-reported training activity. The smartphone application was made publicly available for interested users to quantify training effect. Here we analyze data acquired over a period of 3 weeks to 5 months, including 797 users, breaking down results by gender and age group. Our results suggest a strong relation between HR, HRV and self-reported training load independent of gender and age group. HRV changes due to training were larger than those of HR. We conclude that smartphone-based training monitoring is feasible and a can be used as a practical tool to support large populations outside controlled laboratory environments.

  Title: Designing a Social Mobile Platform for Diabetes Self-management: A Theory-Driven Perspective
  Abstract: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasingly being accepted as a lifelong public health problem with profound consequences on the worldwide healthcare system. Self-management, therefore, has been long suggested as an integral solu- tion of diabetes treatment (1) which requires patients to adopt strained lifestyle modifications (e.g., balancing diets and frequent monitoring of blood glucose) (2, 3). With the proliferation of smart devices, this study proposes a theoretical framework as an important guideline for designing and prototyping a life- changing mobile platform for a next-generation diabetes self-management. It revolutionises the interaction between patients and their smart phone with a high degree of media richness and social connectivity for better health management success.

  Title: Characterizing reinforcement learning methods through parameterized learning problems
  Abstract: The field of reinforcement learning (RL) has been energized in the past few decades by elegant theoretical results indicating under what conditions, and how quickly, certain algorithms are guaranteed to converge to optimal policies. However, in practical problems, these conditions are seldom met. When we cannot achieve optimality, the performance of RL algorithms must be measured empirically. Consequently, in order to meaningfully differentiate learning methods, it becomes necessary to characterize their performance on different problems, taking into account factors such as state estimation, exploration, function approximation, and constraints on computation and memory. To this end, we propose parameterized learning problems, in which such factors can be controlled systematically and their effects on learning methods characterized through targeted studies. Apart from providing very precise control of the parameters that affect learning, our parameterized learning problems enable benchmarking against optimal behavior; their relatively small sizes facilitate extensive experimentation.#R##N##R##N#Based on a survey of existing RL applications, in this article, we focus our attention on two predominant, "first order" factors: partial observability and function approximation. We design an appropriate parameterized learning problem, through which we compare two qualitatively distinct classes of algorithms: on-line value function-based methods and policy search methods. Empirical comparisons among various methods within each of these classes project Sarsa(?) and Q-learning(?) as winners among the former, and CMA-ES as the winner in the latter. Comparing Sarsa(?) and CMA-ES further on relevant problem instances, our study highlights regions of the problem space favoring their contrasting approaches. Short run-times for our experiments allow for an extensive search procedure that provides additional insights on relationships between method-specific parameters--such as eligibility traces, initial weights, and population sizes--and problem instances.

  Title: Emergence of Cooperation: State of the Art
  Abstract: This review presents a review of prevalent results within research pertaining to emergent cooperation in biologically inspired artificial social systems. Results reviewed maintain particular reference to biologically inspired design principles, given that current mathematical and empirical tools have provided only a partial insight into elucidating mechanisms responsible for emergent cooperation, and then only in systems of an abstract nature. This review aims to provide an overview of important and disparate research contributions that investigate utilization of biologically inspired concepts such as emergence, evolution, and self-organization as a means of attaining cooperation in artificial social systems. An introduction and overview of emergent cooperation in artificial life is presented, followed by a survey of emergent cooperation in swarm-based systems, the pursuit-evasion domain, and RoboCup soccer. The final section draws conclusions regarding future directions of emergent cooperation as a problem-solving methodology that is potentially applicable in a wide range of problem domains. Within each of these sections and their respective themes of research, the mechanisms deemed to be responsible for emergent cooperation are elucidated and their key limitations highlighted. The review concludes that current studies in emergent cooperative behavior are limited by a lack of situated and embodied approaches, and by the research infancy of current biologically inspired design approaches. Despite these limiting factors, emergent cooperation maintains considerable future potential in a wide variety of application domains where systems composed of many interacting components must cooperatively perform unanticipated global tasks.

  Title: On Learning to Think: Algorithmic Information Theory for Novel Combinations of Reinforcement Learning Controllers and Recurrent Neural World Models
  Abstract: This paper addresses the general problem of reinforcement learning (RL) in partially observable environments. In 2013, our large RL recurrent neural networks (RNNs) learned from scratch to drive simulated cars from high-dimensional video input. However, real brains are more powerful in many ways. In particular, they learn a predictive model of their initially unknown environment, and somehow use it for abstract (e.g., hierarchical) planning and reasoning. Guided by algorithmic information theory, we describe RNN-based AIs (RNNAIs) designed to do the same. Such an RNNAI can be trained on never-ending sequences of tasks, some of them provided by the user, others invented by the RNNAI itself in a curious, playful fashion, to improve its RNN-based world model. Unlike our previous model-building RNN-based RL machines dating back to 1990, the RNNAI learns to actively query its model for abstract reasoning and planning and decision making, essentially "learning to think." The basic ideas of this report can be applied to many other cases where one RNN-like system exploits the algorithmic information content of another. They are taken from a grant proposal submitted in Fall 2014, and also explain concepts such as "mirror neurons." Experimental results will be described in separate papers.

  Title: Online fitted policy iteration based on extreme learning machines
  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a learning paradigm that can be useful in a wide variety of real-world applications. However, its applicability to complex problems remains problematic due to different causes. Particularly important among these are the high quantity of data required by the agent to learn useful policies and the poor scalability to high-dimensional problems due to the use of local approximators. This paper presents a novel RL algorithm, called online fitted policy iteration (OFPI), that steps forward in both directions. OFPI is based on a semi-batch scheme that increases the convergence speed by reusing data and enables the use of global approximators by reformulating the value function approximation as a standard supervised problem. The proposed method has been empirically evaluated in three benchmark problems. During the experiments, OFPI has employed a neural network trained with the extreme learning machine algorithm to approximate the value functions. Results have demonstrated the stability of OFPI using a global function approximator and also performance improvements over two baseline algorithms (SARSA and Q-learning) combined with eligibility traces and a radial basis function network.

  Title: Multiagent Reinforcement Learning: Spiking and Nonspiking Agents in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
  Abstract: This paper investigates multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) in a general-sum game where the payoffs' structure is such that the agents are required to exploit each other in a way that benefits all agents. The contradictory nature of these games makes their study in multiagent systems quite challenging. In particular, we investigate MARL with spiking and nonspiking agents in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma by exploring the conditions required to enhance its cooperative outcome. The spiking agents are neural networks with leaky integrate-and-fire neurons trained with two different learning algorithms: 1) reinforcement of stochastic synaptic transmission, or 2) reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity with eligibility trace. The nonspiking agents use a tabular representation and are trained with Q- and SARSA learning algorithms, with a novel reward transformation process also being applied to the Q-learning agents. According to the results, the cooperative outcome is enhanced by: 1) transformed internal reinforcement signals and a combination of a high learning rate and a low discount factor with an appropriate exploration schedule in the case of non-spiking agents, and 2) having longer eligibility trace time constant in the case of spiking agents. Moreover, it is shown that spiking and nonspiking agents have similar behavior and therefore they can equally well be used in a multiagent interaction setting. For training the spiking agents in the case where more than one output neuron competes for reinforcement, a novel and necessary modification that enhances competition is applied to the two learning algorithms utilized, in order to avoid a possible synaptic saturation. This is done by administering to the networks additional global reinforcement signals for every spike of the output neurons that were not “responsible” for the preceding decision.

  Title: Swarm robotics: a review from the swarm engineering perspective
  Abstract: Swarm robotics is an approach to collective robotics that takes inspiration from the self-organized behaviors of social animals. Through simple rules and local interactions, swarm robotics aims at designing robust, scalable, and flexible collective behaviors for the coordination of large numbers of robots. In this paper, we analyze the literature from the point of view of swarm engineering: we focus mainly on ideas and concepts that contribute to the advancement of swarm robotics as an engineering field and that could be relevant to tackle real-world applications. Swarm engineering is an emerging discipline that aims at defining systematic and well founded procedures for modeling, designing, realizing, verifying, validating, operating, and maintaining a swarm robotics system. We propose two taxonomies: in the first taxonomy, we classify works that deal with design and analysis methods; in the second taxonomy, we classify works according to the collective behavior studied. We conclude with a discussion of the current limits of swarm robotics as an engineering discipline and with suggestions for future research directions.

  Title: An Introduction to Collective Intelligence
  Abstract: This paper surveys the emerging science of how to design a “COllective INtelligence” (COIN). A COIN is a large multi-agent system where: i) There is little to no centralized communication or control. ii) There is a provided world utility function that rates the possible histories of the full system. In particular, we are interested in COINs in which each agent runs a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. The conventional approach to designing large distributed systems to optimize a world utility does not use agents running RL algorithms. Rather, that approach begins with explicit modeling of the dynamics of the overall system, followed by detailed hand-tuning of the interactions between the components to ensure that they “cooperate” as far as the world utility is concerned. This approach is labor-intensive, often results in highly nonrobust systems, and usually results in design techniques that have limited applicability. In contrast, we wish to solve the COIN design problem implicitly, via the “adaptive” character of the RL algorithms of each of the agents. This approach introduces an entirely new, profound design problem: Assuming the RL algorithms are able to achieve high rewards, what reward functions for the individual agents will, when pursued by those agents, result in high world utility? In other words, what reward functions will best ensure that we do not have phenomena like the tragedy of the commons, Braess’s paradox, or the liquidity trap? Although still very young, research specifically concentrating on the COIN design problem has already resulted in successes in artificial domains, in particular in packet-routing, the leader-follower problem, and in variants of Arthur’s El Farol bar problem. It is expected that as it matures and draws upon other disciplines related to COINs, this research will greatly expand the range of tasks addressable by human engineers. Moreover, in addition to drawing on them, such a fully developed science of COIN design may provide much insight into other already established scientific fields, such as economics, game theory, and population biology.

  Title: Empirical Studies in Action Selection with Reinforcement Learning
  Abstract: To excel in challenging tasks, intelligent agents need sophisticated mechanisms for action selection: they need policies that dictate what action to take in each situation. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to learn such policies given only positive and negative rewards. Two contrasting approaches to RL that are currently in popular use are temporal difference (TD) methods, which learn value functions, and evolutionary methods, which optimize populations of candidate policies. Both approaches have had practical successes but few studies have directly compared them. Hence, there are no general guidelines describing their relative strengths and weaknesses. In addition, there has been little cross-collaboration, with few attempts to make them work together or to apply ideas from one to the other. In this article we aim to address these shortcomings via three empirical studies that compare these methods and investigate new ways of making them work together.#R##N##R##N#First, we compare the two approaches in a benchmark task and identify variations of the task that isolate factors critical to the performance of each method. Second, we investigate ways to make evolutionary algorithms excel at on-line tasks by borrowing exploratory mechanisms traditionally used by TD methods. We present empirical results demonstrating a dramatic performance improvement. Third, we explore a novel way of making evolutionary and TD methods work together by using evolution to automatically discover good representations for TD function approximators. We present results demonstrating that this novel approach can outperform both TD and evolutionary methods alone.

  Title: Learning to Drive in the Open Racing Car Simulator Using Online Neuroevolution
  Abstract: In this paper, we applied online neuroevolution to evolve nonplayer characters for The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS). While previous approaches allowed online learning with performance improvements during each generation, our approach enables a finer grained online learning with performance improvements within each lap. We tested our approach on three tracks using two methods of online neuroevolution (NEAT and rtNEAT) combined with four evaluation strategies ( -greedy, -greedy-improved, softmax, and interval-based) taken from the literature. We compared the eight resulting configurations on several driving tasks involving the learning of a driving behavior for a specific track, its adaptation to a new track, and the generalization capability to unknown tracks. The results we present show that, notwithstanding the several challenges that online learning poses, our approach 1) can successfully evolve drivers from scratch, 2) can also be used to transfer evolved knowledge to other tracks, and 3) can generalize effectively producing controllers that can drive on difficult unseen tracks. Our results also suggest that the approach performs better when coupled with online NEAT and also indicate that -greedy-improved and softmax are generally better than the other evaluation strategies. A comparison with typical offline neuroevolution suggests that online neuroevolution can be competitive and even outperform traditional offline approaches on more difficult tracks while providing all the interesting features of online learning. Overall, we believe that this study may represent an initial step toward the application of online neuroevolution in games.

  Title: Opposition based computing — A survey
  Abstract: In algorithms design, one of the important aspects is to consider efficiency. Many algorithm design paradigms are existed and used in order to enhance algorithms' efficiency. Opposition-based Learning (OBL) paradigm was recently introduced as a new way of thinking during the design of algorithms. The concepts of opposition have already been used and applied in several applications. These applications are from different fields, such as optimization algorithms, learning algorithms and fuzzy logic. The reported results confirm that OBL paradigm was promising to accelerate or to enhance accuracy of soft computing algorithms. In this paper, a survey of existing applications of opposition-based computing is presented.
